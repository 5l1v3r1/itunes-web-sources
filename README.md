# iTunes Web Sources for MP3Tag
What's this?

Let me explain, with the help of MP3Tag, you can automatically download album art, artist name, album name, composer (not the real one but that's cool), year, genre and many many things...

You don't need to search for the artist name or album art on google, this source downloads it automatically...

# Instructions

1 - Download [MP3Tag](http://www.mp3tag.de/en/download.html)

2 - Download my Source (go to ***Releases***)

3 - Install the MP3Tag and open it

4 - Copy the the ***.src*** files to ***%appdata%\mp3tag\data\sources*** and ***.mta*** to ***%appdata%\mp3tag\data\actions***

5 - Open the program, from now on, i'll explain with screenshots.

# Using the Source

So, let's see how it works right?

I have the _Cry Baby album from Melanie Martinez_ here to use as [example](http://i.imgur.com/Uc5Zow2.png), as you can see on the screenshots, [there are no tags on it](http://i.imgur.com/NzTaCc8.png), so, let's add them automatically

Click on [***Tag Sources***](http://i.imgur.com/znY5NDV.png)

Move you mouse to [***iTunes***](http://i.imgur.com/ZxG9dLO.png)

[Select any Country (in this case i'll use USA)](http://i.imgur.com/F9Fglcp.png)

[On the box](http://i.imgur.com/UOWggFk.png), put the ***Artist name*** and the ***Album name***

On the ***Search Results***, choose one on the search results, in this case, we'll choose the first one.

There we are, [the tag information](http://i.imgur.com/bCJXbyE.png), [on the right side](http://i.imgur.com/nnDuUdu.png) you'll need to [allign with the left side](http://i.imgur.com/NCMvHuN.png), after you did the allignment, click OK.

[***Now the album is fully tagged***](http://i.imgur.com/lbikgiq.png)

***HEY! THE DEFAULT SIZE OF THE COVER IS THE HIGHEST! YOU CAN CHANGE IT BY YOURSELF ON "COVERURL" INSIDE THE SCRIPT!!!***

# Extras

If your music is with strange names like [blahblahblahmp3.com] or [anything else](http://i.imgur.com/4XPYWI3.png), i'll show you how to 'fix' it

Select the music then click the ***Tag - Filename*** [button](http://i.imgur.com/3aiHVIy.png)

[On the box](http://i.imgur.com/TuIIntI.png) put ***%track% - %title*** then click ***OK***.

[ ***Done.*** ](http://i.imgur.com/nEOUTpO.png)

# Actions

There's a folder names "Extras" when you download my script, that can be used to add two flags: Gapless and Compilation, should be useful for some users, move the two .mta files to **%appdata%\Mp3tag\data\actions** and you can use it [here](https://i.imgur.com/jXmmtQz.png).

# Issues

***Please report any [issues](https://github.com/jonaaa20/itunes-web-sources/issues) with my script.***

**BEFORE CREATING ANY NEW ISSUES, PLEASE CHECK IF YOU'RE USING THE LATEST VERSION!**
